# Code Review: ByteBiteRestaurants

## Overview

This document provides a detailed code review of the ByteBiteRestaurants project. The review covers the microservice design, use of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, security, messaging integration, service discovery, configuration, and Docker setup.

## 1. Microservice Design and Structure

The project is well-structured, with each microservice in its own directory. The use of a parent `pom.xml` to manage common dependencies is a good practice. The microservices are:

- **`api-gateway`**: The single entry point for all client requests.
- **`auth-service`**: Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **`config-server`**: Centralized configuration server.
- **`discovery-server`**: Service registry and discovery.
- **`notification-service`**: Sends notifications to users.
- **`order-service`**: Manages the order lifecycle.
- **`restaurant-service`**: Manages restaurant and food menu data.

### Observations

- The microservice decomposition is logical and follows the principles of domain-driven design.
- Each microservice has a clear and distinct responsibility.
- The use of a dedicated `api-gateway` is a good practice for a microservices architecture.

### Suggestions

- Consider adding a `README.md` file to each microservice directory to provide a brief overview of the service and its responsibilities.

## 2. Use of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud

The project makes extensive use of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, which is appropriate for a microservices architecture.

### Observations

- **Spring Boot**: Each microservice is a Spring Boot application, which simplifies the development and deployment process.
- **Spring Cloud**: The project uses Spring Cloud for service discovery (`discovery-server`), centralized configuration (`config-server`), and API gateway (`api-gateway`).

### Suggestions

- The version of Spring Cloud used is `2025.0.0`, which is a future release. It is recommended to use a stable and released version of Spring Cloud.

## 3. Security (JWT, RBAC, resource ownership)

The project uses JWT for authentication and authorization.

### Observations

- **JWT**: The `auth-service` is responsible for generating and validating JWTs. The `api-gateway` and other microservices use JWTs to authenticate and authorize requests.
- **RBAC**: The `auth-service` uses role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to certain endpoints based on the user's role.
- **Resource Ownership**: The `order-service` and `restaurant-service` implement resource ownership checks to ensure that users can only access their own resources.

### Suggestions

- The JWT secret key is hardcoded in the `application.properties` file. It is recommended to use a more secure way to store the secret key, such as environment variables or a secret management tool.

## 4. Messaging Integration (Kafka/RabbitMQ)

The project uses Kafka for asynchronous communication between microservices.

### Observations

- **Kafka**: The `order-service` and `restaurant-service` use Kafka to communicate with the `notification-service`.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The use of Kafka enables an event-driven architecture, which improves the scalability and resilience of the system.

### Suggestions

- The Kafka configuration is hardcoded in the `application.properties` file. It is recommended to use the `config-server` to manage the Kafka configuration.

## 5. Service Discovery and Configuration

The project uses Spring Cloud for service discovery and configuration.

### Observations

- **Service Discovery**: The `discovery-server` is used as a service registry, and all other microservices register with it.
- **Centralized Configuration**: The `config-server` is used to manage the configuration for all microservices.

### Suggestions

- The `config-server` is configured to use a Git repository as the backend. This is a good practice, but it is recommended to use a more secure way to store the Git credentials, such as environment variables or a secret management tool.

## 6. Docker and Deployment Setup

The project uses Docker to containerize the application.

### Observations

- **Docker Compose**: The `docker-compose.yml` file is used to define the services and their dependencies.
- **Containerization**: Each microservice is containerized, which simplifies the deployment process.

### Suggestions

- The `docker-compose.yml` file only includes the Kafka service. It is recommended to include all the microservices in the `docker-compose.yml` file to simplify the deployment process.

## Conclusion

The ByteBiteRestaurants project is a well-designed and well-structured microservices application. The use of Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Kafka is appropriate for a microservices architecture. The project has a good security model and a good deployment setup. There are a few areas for improvement, but overall, the project is in good shape.
